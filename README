# sfRADIUSAuthPlugin #

The sfRADIUSAuthPlugin allows to use a RADIUS server to authenticate sfGuard users in symfony projects.

## Prerequisites ##

* installed and working RADIUS extension from [PECL](http://pecl.php.net/package/radius "PECL")
* optionally: [PEAR](http://pear.php.net/package/Auth_Radius), Auth_RADIUS and Crypt_CHAP

   The second step is not mandatory, as a version of these libs is bundled with the plugin.
   However the plugin should use the PEAR versions in the future, if PEAR is available

## Installation ## 

* install the plugin

	    symfony plugin:install sfRADIUSAuthPlugin
  
* copy the plugins app.yml and fill in your values

        all:
          sfRADIUSAuth:
            #wether to enable the plugin or not.
            enabled: true
	        # the password authtype the server uses: one of
	        # MSCHAPv2
	        # MSCHAPv1 (not implemented currently)
	        # PAP (not implemented currently)
	        # CHAP_MD5 (not implemented currently)
	        auth_type: MSCHAPv2
	        # ip or dns-name of the server to use
	        server:  radius.yourdomain.com
	        # ports to use for authentication (accounting is not available atm!)
	        port:
	          auth:  1234
	          acc:   1235
	        # shared secret to use when communicating with the radius server
	        secret: SomeSharedSecretYourRadiusAdminGaveYou

* add password_callable setting to your app.yml, so that sfGuard knows which method to call
  Currently, this can not be automated. Later versions of the plugin should do this by themself.
  
        all:
          sf_guard_plugin:
            check_password_callable: [sfRADIUSAuth, authenticateUser]

## Usage ##

* if you done all the steps above, your ready to go.
* configure your users through sfGuard. Password-checking will be done automatically via RADIUS.
